# Facial and Speech Emotion Detection

This is my final year btech project. The project has following features:

- Analyze emotion from recorded voice( Here, user will upload a voice, and
our model will predict the emotion from that voice)


- Analyze emotion from uploaded face image( Here, user will upload a facial
image, and our model predict the emotion from that image)

- Live face capturing to analyze emotion ( user will capture his/her face to
analyze emotions. We will do that using open-cv in python).
